/**
 * This class is intended to help devops with solving the problems they face on
 * a daily basis when developing software. Usally their work needs them to
 * follow workflows to solve tasks. Most of the tasks contain a set of steps
 * which lead to successful solving of the task. For example the gitflow
 * workflow task of releasing a feature in a new version of a software contains
 * the steps of merging the develop branch into the feature, than merging the
 * feature into develop, than creating a release from develop and pointing
 * master to the release and so on. These are a lot of steps, where something
 * can go wrong. If something goes wrong in such a task, it usually means that
 * there is time, which has to be invested solving the things which have gone
 * wrong. The task class will help avoiding having to invest time to solve
 * problems created in such automatble tasks. The class will ensure, that all
 * tasks created, will follow rules and restrictions to avoid making mistakes.
 * For that for example, it forces the developer to implement a function which
 * checks, if all prerequisites for fullfilling a task are met, before running
 * the task itself. Staying with the gitflow-example, it is possible, that the
 * current feature branch isn't clean or that develop could not be automatically
 * be merged into the feature. The function which checks the prerequisites will
 * tell the developer, which prerequisites are not fullfilled and creates
 * attention for the possible errors/problems which could arise in the process
 * of working through the task. Another thing the class will help with is to log
 * the results of the substeps of a task. This will help with debugging possible
 * errors.
 *
 * Tasks, implementing this class need to be named in the pattern of
 * NameOfTaskTask. The export name must follow the pattern TNameOfTask.
 *
 * @param name  The name of the task
 * @param runStartTime  The start time of the task
 * @param runEndTime  The time, when the task finished
