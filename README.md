# SYSTEM DESIGN

## Utility Classes
- offer Helper functions for Tasks
- these functions are really basic and each can be viewed as a step of tasks

## Task Classes
- extend the TaskUtility Class which offers helperfunctions for running a task
  - runBefore(): logs the name and the start time of a task
  - runAfter(): logs the end time and duration of a task
- implement the TaskInterface
  - run(): have a run function, which runs the steps of the task
  - check(): have a check function, which checks, if all prerequisites for
    running the task are met
- are using the functions of Uitility Classes to solve multistep tasks
