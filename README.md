# YAGPT (yet another general purpose tool)
This is hopefully the last npm package i write. In the last years i every once
in a while created a npm package for solving specific tasks i had to do on a
regular basis. Usually, at some point in time I forgot about the package and
then later, as i faced the problem again, somehow wasn't able to find the
package i had created ealier. This is why i then usually created a new one and
reinvented my wheels again. So this time i voted for the monorepo-approach with
the hope of avoiding that old problem and being able to keep the whole package
on a modern standard with less effort.

So this package is a combination of a task-runner and a project-manager. I will
add features over time and besides my implement-on-linux-first-approach, try
to make it usable on windows/mac and maybe later others too.

Shortly after starting the project i read the book, "A Philosophy of Software
Design" by John Ousterhout. The book elevated my skilllevels in programming
and software design really a lot, why i wanted to mention it here. The book
influenced a lot of design-decisions i made for that package.

I intend to use the work on this package for:
1. learning new techniques
2. becoming a better software-designer/-architect and programmer
3. creating automatisms for tasks i have to do regularly
4. beeing a template/styleguide for projects i will do in collaboration with
   other programmers.
